        <p>data.gg  is  the  brain-child  of  <a  href="http://www.jasemagee.com/">Jason  Magee</a>  and
            Kieran  Senior  with  the  aim  of  providing  all  Bailiwick  of  Guernsey-related  data
            to  the  public  through  an  easily  accessible  API  in  many  formats  which  suit  those  using  it.  Currently  we  support  XML,  JSON,  HTML
            and  soon  we  shall  be  supporting  Object  data  formats  along  with  gzipped  formats  of  all.  data.gg  is  and  will  always  be  non-profit.</p>

        <h2  class="text-center">The  Reason</h2>
        <p>Because  we  are  far  behind  other  places  in  the  world,  and  to  push  forward  with  software  we  need  one  thing:  data.  The  problem  is
            that  data  isn't  readily  available  and  is  hidden  away  in  PDF  files  or  random  HTML  pages  with  no  apparent  structure.  We  had  many
            ideas  we  wanted  to  'get  out  there'  but  for  each  project  we  needed  an  API  to  integrate  with,  and  so  data.gg  was  born.</p>

            <h2  class="text-center">Philosophy</h2>
            <p>We  believe  that  we  should  live  in  a  world  where  we  are  self-reliant,  turning  our  dependencies  from  the  government  and  instead
                relying  on  ourselves.  We  believe  that  each  and  every  one  of  us  has  a  unique  set  of  expertise  that  can  be  used  for  the  benefit
                of  others,  and  data.gg  is  just  one  expression  of  that  belief.  Chief  Minister  Jon  Le  Tocq  spoke  of  this  more  elegantly
                when  he  said:</p>

            <blockquote  class="text-justify"  style="margin-top:30px;"><p>It  is,  as  all  well  know,  increasingly  unrealistic  and  unnecessary  for  the  States  to  do  everything.  This  is  not  a
                financial  argument,  although  of  course  it  works  in  that  perspective.  It  is  also  a  realisation  that  there  are  people
                with  better  expertise  and  understanding  of  what  is  needed  on  the  Island,  and  how  it  can  be  most  effectively  and  efficiently  delivered.</p>
