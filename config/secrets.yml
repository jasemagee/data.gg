#  Your  secret  key  is  used  for  verifying  the  integrity  of  signed  cookies.
#  If  you  change  this  key,  all  old  signed  cookies  will  become  invalid!

#  Make  sure  the  secret  is  at  least  30  characters  and  all  random,
#  no  regular  words  or  you'll  be  exposed  to  dictionary  attacks.
#  You  can  use  `rails  secret`  to  generate  a  secure  secret  key.

#  Make  sure  the  secrets  in  this  file  are  kept  private
#  if  you're  sharing  your  code  publicly.

#  Shared  secrets  are  available  across  all  environments.

#  Environmental  secrets  are  only  available  for  that  specific  environment.
